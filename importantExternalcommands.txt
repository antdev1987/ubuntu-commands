to refresh ubuntu this is one option

I would first try this quick GUI way to see if restarts GNOME, but in case your desktop is fully frozen and doesn’t respond, you should try method 2.

Step 1) Press ALT and F2 simultaneously. In modern laptop, you may need to additionally press the Fn key too (if it exists) to activate Function keys.

Step 2) Type r in the command box and press enter.

Method 2: From Terminal

Step 1) Launch ‘Terminal’.

Step 2) Enter the following command and press enter.

gnome-shell --replace & disown
