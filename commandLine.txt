##### $pwd #####
the print working directory command is super simple but very useful, think of it -
as a "where am I" command.
it will print the path of your current working directory, starting from the root /
for example, if I were on my desktop and I ran pwd, I would see /home/colt/desktop

##### $ls or $ls /home/nicolle #####
The list command will list the contents of a directory.
when used with no options or arguments, it prints a list of the files and folders -
located in the current directory.
We can also list the contents of a specific directory using "ls path". for example -
$ls /bin will print the contents of the /bin directory.
